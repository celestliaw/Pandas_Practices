# Pandas Exercises

After going through the abundance of tutorials but the lack of accessible exercises, I decided to create a repository dedicated solely to practicing pandas. While tutorials are valuable, hands-on practice is essential for learning. Thus, unless you actively engage in exercises, you won't truly master the material. I'm using this repository for training purposes, including tutoring secondary students and beyond.
